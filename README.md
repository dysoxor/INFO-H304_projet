# INFO-H304_projet
project info-H304 2019-2020 written by Andrey Sobolevsky, Franck Trouillez and Tristan Smeesters

The final version of codes is in the 'FINAL_WORK' folder which contains also a 'README' explaining how execute the code. The alignment is calculated with Smith-Waterman algorithm and optimised with threads and SIMD. Result files (.txt) of P00533, Q9Y6V0 and P07327 are available in the folder.

A reduced database can be made by compiling and executing codes in 'create_database'.

The simpliest form of this work is in 'INTERMEDIATE_WORK' which only find the perfect match of the query in the database.

Codes written from the begining to the end of the project are stored in 'PROGRESS'.
